pgmpy documentation (expanded)

Overview
pgmpy is a Python library for causal inference and probabilistic graphical models. It supports structure learning,
parameter estimation, probabilistic inference, causal identification, causal effect estimation, metrics, datasets,
model import/export, and simulation from Bayesian Networks.

Audience
This documentation targets data scientists and engineers who want practical workflows for learning and using
Bayesian Networks and causal graphs.
